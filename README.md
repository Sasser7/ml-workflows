<h1 align="center">🤖 Machine Learning Workflows ⚒️</h1>

Welcome to my curated compilation of machine learning workflows! Currently, this compilation focuses on **Linear Regression** workflows, utilizing various powerful tools and packages.

## 🛠️ Current Workflows: 
- **[Linear regression](workflows/linear-regression.ipynb)** 📈: statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes that this relationship can be represented by a straight line.

### 📦 Tools & Packages:
- **[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)** 🖥️: A web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.
- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)** 📊: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** 🐼: A fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
- **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)** 🔢: A Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
- **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)** 🔥: A machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella.
- **[Safetensors](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/)** 🧱: A new simple format for storing tensors safely (as opposed to pickle) and that is still fast (zero-copy).

Happy coding! 💻✨
