<h1 align="center">🤖 Machine Learning Workflows ⚒️</h1>

Welcome to my curated compilation of machine learning workflows utilizing various powerful tools and packages!

## 🛠️ Current Workflows: 
- **[Linear regression](workflows/linear-regression.ipynb)** 📈: A model that estimates the linear relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.
- **[Binary classification](workflows/binary-classification.ipynb)** 📊: The task of classifying the elements of a set into one of two groups.

### 📦 Tools & Packages:
- **[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)** 🖥️: A web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.
- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)** 📊: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** 🐼: A fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
- **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)** 🔢: A Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, Fourier transform, and matrices.
- **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)** 🔥: A machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella.
- **[Safetensors](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/)** 🧱: A new simple format for storing tensors safely (as opposed to pickle) and that is still fast (zero-copy).

Happy coding! 💻✨
